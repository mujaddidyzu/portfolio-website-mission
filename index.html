            <p>The SLS flight in March will not include astronauts. During the test mission, NASA’s Orion spacecraft
                will launch
                from the SLS rocket and travel 450,600 kilometers from Earth. NASA says this is farther than any
                spacecraft
                built for humans has ever traveled. The mission is expected to last four to six weeks.</p>

                    initiation of new mental accounting periods... [such as] time dividers on the yearly calendar.”
